Before you can push the .NET Core sample app to {{ product_full }},
you must have the following:

- A Cloud Foundry deployment. For more information, see [Deploying Cloud Foundry with cf-deployment](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/deploying/cf-deployment/).
- Your username and password for your Cloud Foundry instance.
- The organization and space in the Linux environment where you want to deploy
the .NET sample app. A Cloud Foundry workspace is organized into organizations,
and within them, spaces. As a Cloud Foundry user, you have access to one or more
organizations and spaces.
- The API endpoint for your Cloud Foundry instance.
