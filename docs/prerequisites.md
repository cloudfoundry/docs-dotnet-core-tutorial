Before you can push the .NET Core sample app to {{ product_full }},
you must have the following:

- A Cloud Foundry deployment. For more information, see [Deploying Cloud Foundry with cf-deployment](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/deploying/cf-deployment/).
- The API endpoint for your Cloud Foundry instance.
- Your username and password for your Cloud Foundry instance.
- An org and space in a Linux environment to deploy the .NET sample app.
To deploy the app to your chosen org and space, you must have the Space
Developer role at minimum.
